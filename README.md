# Unequal Playbook: How Coaching Disparities Shape Black Careers in the National Football League

### Data Sources (2013â€“2024)

Two primary datasets were manually compiled to perform both individual- and structural-level analysis of race and coaching opportunity insights. The two data datasets consist of:

(1) 85 NFL head coach hires, constructed from annual Diversity and Inclusion Reports published by the NFL Operations Office (2013â€“2024), official team announcements, and verified public biographical data.

(2) League-wide structural context for each year, sourced from the NFLâ€™s reports and Racial and Gender Report Cards published by The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES).
